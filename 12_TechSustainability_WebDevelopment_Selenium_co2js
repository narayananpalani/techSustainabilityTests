Test Case: Web Development Optimization through co2js Integration with Selenium for CO2e Analysis

**Test Case ID:** WDOS-001  
**Test Case Title:** Web Development Optimization through co2js Integration with Selenium for CO2e Analysis

**Objective:** To verify the successful integration of the co2js library with Selenium for CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) analysis on each web page, and to ensure that the CO2e values are properly logged in the logs for improving tech sustainability.

**Preconditions:**
1. A web application to be tested is available.
2. co2js library is integrated into the web application's codebase.
3. Selenium WebDriver is set up for automated testing.
4. Logging mechanisms are in place to capture CO2e values.

**Test Steps:**

**Step 1:** Navigate to Web Page

1. Use Selenium WebDriver to navigate to a specific web page of the application.

**Expected Result:** The specified web page is successfully loaded.

**Step 2:** Capture CO2e Data

1. Execute co2js functions or methods integrated into the web application's codebase to calculate the CO2e emitted during the page load.
2. Extract the calculated CO2e value.

**Expected Result:** The CO2e value is accurately calculated and extracted.

**Step 3:** Log CO2e Data

1. Log the extracted CO2e value in the application's logs, along with relevant information about the page being tested.

**Expected Result:** The CO2e value and associated information are successfully logged.

**Step 4:** Repeat for Multiple Pages

1. Repeat Steps 1-3 for various pages of the web application, covering different types of content and interactions.

**Expected Result:** CO2e values are captured and logged for each tested web page.

**Step 5:** Analyze CO2e Values

1. Collect the logged CO2e values from the application's logs.
2. Calculate average CO2e values, identify pages with high emissions, and analyze trends.

**Expected Result:** Analyzed CO2e values provide insights into areas of the web application that may need optimization for improved sustainability.

**Step 6:** Optimize High-Emission Pages (Optional)

1. Based on the analysis, identify high-emission pages or areas.
2. Implement optimization strategies to reduce the CO2e emissions on those pages (e.g., optimizing images, reducing unnecessary scripts).

**Expected Result:** Optimization efforts result in decreased CO2e emissions on identified high-emission pages.

**Step 7:** Verify CO2e Reduction (Optional)

1. Repeat Steps 1-5 after implementing optimizations on previously high-emission pages.
2. Compare the new CO2e values with the initial values.

**Expected Result:** Optimized pages should show reduced CO2e emissions compared to the initial measurements.

**Postconditions:**
1. CO2e analysis using co2js and Selenium integration has been successfully executed on the web application.
2. CO2e values have been logged and analyzed for optimization.

**Notes:**
- The specifics of integrating co2js, logging mechanisms, and optimization strategies will depend on the web application's codebase and technologies used.
- The test case focuses on the process of integration, data capture, and analysis. Further optimization steps are optional and can be tailored to the application's needs.
