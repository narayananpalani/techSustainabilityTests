Test Case: Web Development Optimization through Tree Shaking Code Cleaning

**Test Case ID:** WDOTT-001  
**Test Case Title:** Web Development Optimization through Tree Shaking Code Cleaning

**Objective:** To verify the effectiveness of web development optimization using tree shaking to clean and reduce the size of the codebase, improving technical sustainability and performance.

**Preconditions:**
1. A web application with JavaScript codebase containing unused or redundant code.
2. A compatible development environment and build tool that supports tree shaking.

**Test Steps:**

**Step 1:** Identify Unused Code

1. Perform a thorough code review to identify unused, dead, or redundant code segments in the JavaScript codebase.

**Expected Result:** A list of unused code segments and modules should be compiled.

**Step 2:** Configure Build Tool

1. Open the project's configuration file for the build tool (e.g., webpack.config.js, rollup.config.js).
2. Ensure that the tree shaking feature is enabled in the build configuration.

**Expected Result:** The build tool is configured to perform tree shaking during the build process.

**Step 3:** Perform Build

1. Run the build command to bundle the web application.
2. Monitor the build process logs for any errors or warnings related to code elimination.

**Expected Result:** The build process should complete without errors or warnings related to code elimination.

**Step 4:** Analyze Bundle Size

1. After the build is complete, locate the bundled JavaScript file(s) generated by the build process.
2. Analyze the size of the bundled file(s) using tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer or a similar tool.

**Expected Result:** The bundled file size should be reduced, indicating that unused code has been successfully eliminated through tree shaking.

**Step 5:** Test Application Functionality

1. Deploy the optimized application to a development or testing environment.
2. Thoroughly test the application's functionality and interactions to ensure that critical features remain unaffected by the code cleaning process.

**Expected Result:** The application should function correctly, with no adverse impact on user experience or functionality due to code cleaning.

**Step 6:** Monitor Performance

1. Use performance monitoring tools to assess the application's loading time and runtime performance.
2. Compare the performance metrics to those of the unoptimized version of the application.

**Expected Result:** The optimized version of the application should demonstrate improved loading times and runtime performance.

**Step 7:** Review Code Changes

1. Review the codebase to ensure that the tree shaking process has not inadvertently removed necessary code segments.
2. Verify that critical functionalities are still intact.

**Expected Result:** No critical functionalities or necessary code segments have been removed during the tree shaking process.

**Step 8:** Regression Testing

1. Execute a comprehensive regression testing suite to validate that all functionalities, including edge cases, are still functioning as expected.

**Expected Result:** All regression tests pass without any new defects introduced by the optimization process.

**Postconditions:**
1. The web application's codebase has been optimized through tree shaking code cleaning.
2. The optimized application demonstrates improved performance without compromising functionality.
3. Any issues, warnings, or observations encountered during the optimization process are documented.

**Notes:**
- Collaboration with the development team and thorough testing are crucial to ensure that tree shaking does not unintentionally break the application.
- It's recommended to create backups of the original code before performing optimization to prevent data loss.
