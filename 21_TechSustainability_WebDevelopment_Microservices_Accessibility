Test Case: Web Development for SDG Goal 10 and Tech Sustainability using Axe DevTools

**Test Case ID:** WDTST-001  
**Test Case Title:** Web Development for SDG Goal 10 using Axe DevTools

**Objective:** To ensure that web development adheres to SDG Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and improves tech sustainability by scanning the website using Axe DevTools for accessibility issues.

**Preconditions:**
1. A web development project is underway.
2. The website or web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. The website is loaded in a supported web browser.
4. Axe DevTools browser extension is installed and enabled.

**Test Steps:**

**Step 1:** Launch Website

1. Open a supported web browser.
2. Load the website or web application that is under development.

**Expected Result:** The website should load without errors and be accessible for testing.

**Step 2:** Open Axe DevTools

1. In the web browser, click on the Axe DevTools browser extension icon.
2. Select the option to analyze the current page for accessibility issues.

**Expected Result:** The Axe DevTools panel should open and display accessibility results for the current page.

**Step 3:** Perform Accessibility Scan

1. In the Axe DevTools panel, click the "Scan" button to start the accessibility scan.
2. Wait for the scan to complete.

**Expected Result:** The accessibility scan should run without errors, and the Axe DevTools panel should display a summary of the scan results.

**Step 4:** Review Scan Results

1. Examine the accessibility issues identified in the scan results.
2. Pay special attention to issues related to SDG Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), such as text alternatives for images, color contrast, keyboard navigation, and ARIA roles.

**Expected Result:** The scan results should provide a list of accessibility issues, including descriptions, severity levels, and affected elements.

**Step 5:** Prioritize and Address Issues

1. Prioritize the accessibility issues based on their severity and impact on SDG Goal 10 and overall tech sustainability.
2. Collaborate with developers, designers, and other team members to create a plan for addressing the identified issues.

**Expected Result:** A prioritized list of accessibility issues to address is created, and a plan is established to fix the issues.

**Step 6:** Implement Fixes

1. Make the necessary changes to the website's code to address the identified accessibility issues.
2. Verify that the changes have been implemented correctly and do not introduce new issues.

**Expected Result:** The implemented fixes should resolve the identified accessibility issues without causing regressions.

**Step 7:** Re-scan for Accessibility

1. Repeat the accessibility scan using Axe DevTools after implementing the fixes.
2. Compare the new scan results with the previous results to verify that the issues have been resolved.

**Expected Result:** The new scan results should show improvements, with fewer or no accessibility issues.

**Step 8:** Test with Different Devices and Browsers

1. Test the website on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) and in various web browsers.
2. Ensure that the accessibility improvements are consistent across different platforms.

**Expected Result:** The website should provide a consistent and accessible experience across different devices and browsers.

**Postconditions:**
1. The website development has been tested and improved for adherence to SDG Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and tech sustainability using Axe DevTools.
2. Accessibility issues have been addressed, improving the overall accessibility of the website.
3. Any challenges faced, lessons learned, and implementation details are documented for future reference.

**Notes:**
- The specific accessibility issues addressed in this test case may vary based on the website's content and context.
- Collaborative efforts among developers, designers, and accessibility experts are crucial for successful accessibility improvements.
