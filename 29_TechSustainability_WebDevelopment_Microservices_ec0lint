Test Case: Web Development Page Scanning using Ec0lint Static Code Analysis

**Test Case ID:** WD-EC0LINT-001  
**Test Case Title:** Web Development Page Scanning using Ec0lint Static Code Analysis

**Objective:** To verify the functionality of scanning a web development page using Ec0lint static code analysis, including installation, configuration, and scanning process, to improve technological sustainability.

**Preconditions:**
1. A web development project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files is available.
2. Ec0lint is installed on the development environment.
3. The project's directory structure and files are ready for scanning.

**Test Steps:**

**Step 1:** Install Ec0lint

1. Open the terminal on the development machine.
2. Run the command to install Ec0lint globally:  
   ```
   npm install -g ec0lint
   ```

**Expected Result:** Ec0lint should be installed successfully without errors.

**Step 2:** Configure Ec0lint

1. In the terminal, navigate to the root directory of the web development project.
2. Run the command to generate a configuration file:  
   ```
   ec0lint init
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to configure Ec0lint settings, including choosing analysis rules, ignoring specific files, etc.

**Expected Result:** The configuration file should be created, and the configuration process should be successful.

**Step 3:** Scan Web Development Page

1. In the terminal, navigate to the root directory of the web development project.
2. Run the command to initiate the Ec0lint scan:  
   ```
   ec0lint
   ```

**Expected Result:** Ec0lint should start scanning the project files based on the configured settings.

**Step 4:** Analyze Scan Results

1. Observe the terminal output as Ec0lint analyzes the project files.
2. Review the scan results, including warnings and errors reported by Ec0lint.

**Expected Result:** Ec0lint should identify and report any issues, violations, or potential improvements based on the defined analysis rules.

**Step 5:** Address Detected Issues

1. Open the identified files with reported issues using a code editor.
2. Locate and modify the code sections where issues were reported to address them.
3. Save the changes.

**Expected Result:** The code changes should effectively address the reported issues.

**Step 6:** Re-scan the Project

1. In the terminal, navigate to the root directory of the web development project.
2. Run the Ec0lint scan command again:  
   ```
   ec0lint
   ```

**Expected Result:** After addressing the reported issues, Ec0lint should indicate that the issues have been resolved or no longer appear.

**Step 7:** Verify Improved Tech Sustainability

1. Review the final scan report or terminal output to confirm that all reported issues have been resolved.
2. Test the web development page in a browser to ensure that the code improvements did not introduce any new issues.

**Expected Result:** The web development page should load and function correctly in the browser, and the code improvements should lead to better technological sustainability.

**Postconditions:**
1. The web development page has been successfully scanned and improved using Ec0lint static code analysis.
2. The final scan report and code improvements are documented.

**Notes:**
- Ec0lint's features, commands, and configuration may vary based on its version and updates.
- It's important to ensure that the Ec0lint configuration and analysis rules are tailored to the project's requirements and coding standards.
