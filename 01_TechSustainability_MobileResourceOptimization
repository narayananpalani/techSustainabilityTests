**Test Case ID:** MDRTU-001  
**Test Case Title:** Mobile Device Resource Utilization for Improved Tech Sustainability

**Objective:** To verify that a mobile device efficiently utilizes resources to contribute to improved tech sustainability.

**Preconditions:**
1. A mobile device with the latest software update and compatible hardware is available.

**Test Steps:**

**Step 1:** Assess Device Hardware and Software

1. Examine the mobile device's specifications, including processor, RAM, storage, and battery capacity.
2. Verify that the device is running the latest software update.

**Expected Result:** The device specifications and software version are documented and ready for testing.

**Step 2:** Launch Basic Apps

1. Open the device's basic apps, such as Phone, Messages, Clock, Calculator.
2. Monitor CPU, RAM, and battery usage using the device's built-in tools or third-party apps.

**Expected Result:** Basic app usage shows minimal CPU and RAM utilization, and battery drain is minimal.

**Step 3:** Test Multitasking

1. Open multiple apps simultaneously, switching between them frequently.
2. Monitor how the device handles multitasking and resource utilization.

**Expected Result:** The device maintains smooth performance and optimal resource utilization during multitasking.

**Step 4:** Run Resource-Intensive Apps

1. Open apps that are known to be resource-intensive, such as games or video editing apps.
2. Monitor CPU, RAM, and battery usage during the usage of these apps.

**Expected Result:** Resource-intensive apps utilize resources efficiently without causing excessive battery drain or performance degradation.

**Step 5:** Test Standby Mode

1. Let the device enter standby mode (screen off) for a period of time.
2. Monitor battery consumption during standby.

**Expected Result:** Battery consumption during standby is minimal, demonstrating efficient power management.

**Step 6:** Test Adaptive Brightness

1. Enable adaptive brightness in the device's display settings.
2. Use the device in various lighting conditions to observe the display's automatic brightness adjustments.

**Expected Result:** The device's display adapts to different lighting conditions, conserving battery without compromising usability.

**Step 7:** Test Battery Saver Mode

1. Enable the device's battery saver mode.
2. Monitor changes in performance, background activity, and resource utilization.

**Expected Result:** Battery saver mode reduces background activity and adjusts performance to extend battery life.

**Step 8:** Monitor Temperature

1. Use resource-intensive apps or activities for an extended period.
2. Monitor the device's temperature using built-in tools or third-party apps.

**Expected Result:** The device temperature remains within safe limits during resource-intensive usage.

**Step 9:** Evaluate Power-Hungry Features

1. Test power-hungry features such as GPS, high-resolution video recording, and mobile data usage.
2. Observe their impact on battery life and resource utilization.

**Expected Result:** Power-hungry features consume resources as expected while providing necessary functionality.

**Step 10:** Test Device Recovery from Low Battery

1. Allow the device's battery to drain to a low level.
2. Observe the device's behavior and performance after charging it to an acceptable level.

**Expected Result:** The device recovers and operates normally after recharging.

**Postconditions:**
1. The mobile device's resource utilization for improved tech sustainability has been successfully tested.
2. Any performance issues, resource inefficiencies, or anomalies encountered during testing are documented.

**Notes:**
- Resource utilization may vary based on the specific device model, software version, and usage scenarios.
- The test case focuses on how a mobile device efficiently manages resources to contribute to improved tech sustainability and user experience.
