Test Case: Mobile App Optimization through Accessibility Scan using axe-mobile in Xcode to Support SDG Goal No.10 (Reduced Inequalities) for Improved Tech Sustainability

**Test Case ID:** MAAO-SDG10-001  
**Test Case Title:** Mobile App Optimization through Accessibility Scan using axe-mobile in Xcode for Improved Tech Sustainability

**Objective:** To verify that a mobile app is optimized for accessibility using axe-mobile in Xcode, in support of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) No.10 (Reduced Inequalities) by ensuring that the app is usable by people with disabilities and provides equal access to technology.

**Preconditions:**
1. The mobile app under test is built using Xcode and is available for testing.
2. The axe-mobile extension is integrated into Xcode for accessibility scanning.

**Test Steps:**

**Step 1:** Open the Mobile App in Xcode

1. Launch Xcode.
2. Open the project for the mobile app to be tested.

**Expected Result:** The project is loaded successfully in Xcode.

**Step 2:** Navigate to the axe-mobile Panel

1. In Xcode, go to "Editor" in the top menu.
2. Choose "axe-mobile" from the dropdown menu.

**Expected Result:** The axe-mobile panel opens within Xcode.

**Step 3:** Start Accessibility Scan

1. In the axe-mobile panel, click on the "Scan" button.
2. Select the relevant device simulator or physical device for testing.
3. Choose the applicable accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1) to scan against.

**Expected Result:** The accessibility scan starts, analyzing the mobile app against the selected accessibility guidelines.

**Step 4:** Review Scan Results

1. After the scan is complete, review the accessibility issues identified by axe-mobile.
2. Inspect each issue to understand the problem and its impact on accessibility.
3. Prioritize issues based on their severity and potential impact on users with disabilities.

**Expected Result:** The scan results provide a clear list of accessibility issues, their impact, and recommendations for improvements.

**Step 5:** Fix Accessibility Issues

1. Address each accessibility issue identified in the scan results.
2. Make necessary code changes, design adjustments, or content modifications to resolve the issues.

**Expected Result:** Accessibility issues are systematically addressed and resolved.

**Step 6:** Rerun Accessibility Scan

1. Re-run the axe-mobile scan on the updated version of the mobile app.
2. Ensure that all previously identified issues have been resolved.

**Expected Result:** The re-scan shows that the previously identified issues are resolved, and there are no new accessibility concerns.

**Step 7:** Test Accessibility on Device

1. Deploy the mobile app to a real device or simulator.
2. Interact with the app using various assistive technologies, such as VoiceOver, TalkBack, or Switch Control.
3. Navigate through the app's interface, perform actions, and access content.

**Expected Result:** The app is accessible and usable using assistive technologies, providing a seamless experience for users with disabilities.

**Step 8:** Repeat Testing for Different Scenarios

1. Test the mobile app in various scenarios, such as different screen sizes, orientations, and font sizes.
2. Ensure that accessibility remains consistent and effective in all scenarios.

**Expected Result:** Accessibility features remain effective and consistent across various scenarios.

**Postconditions:**
1. The mobile app has been successfully optimized for accessibility using axe-mobile in Xcode.
2. Accessibility issues are resolved, improving tech sustainability and supporting SDG Goal No.10 (Reduced Inequalities).

**Notes:**
- The specific accessibility issues and their resolutions may vary based on the app's design, content, and the chosen accessibility guidelines.
- Regular accessibility testing and optimization are essential to ensure ongoing support for people with disabilities and contribute to tech sustainability in line with SDG Goal No.10.
