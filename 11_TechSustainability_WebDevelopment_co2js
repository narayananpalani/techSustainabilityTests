Test Case: Web Development Optimization through co2.js Integration with Cypress for Carbon Emission Tracking

**Test Case ID:** WDOCC-001  
**Test Case Title:** Web Development Optimization through co2.js Integration with Cypress for Carbon Emission Tracking

**Objective:** To verify the successful integration of co2.js with Cypress framework to scan each page, calculate carbon emissions (CO2e), and log emissions data to improve technology sustainability.

**Preconditions:**
1. A web application or website with multiple pages is available for testing.
2. Cypress is set up and configured for running tests on the web application.
3. The co2.js library is integrated into the web application's codebase.

**Test Steps:**

**Step 1:** Access Test Environment

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory of the web application's codebase.
2. Start the Cypress test runner using the command `npx cypress open`.

**Expected Result:** The Cypress test runner interface should open successfully.

**Step 2:** Integration Check

1. In the Cypress test runner, select a test suite or test case that covers navigation through different pages of the web application.
2. Open the selected test case.

**Expected Result:** The selected test case should open in the test runner interface.

**Step 3:** Implement co2.js Integration

1. Inside the selected test case, integrate co2.js to calculate carbon emissions for each page load.
2. Use the appropriate co2.js functions to measure the CO2e emitted during each page load.
3. Log the calculated CO2e value to the test runner's logs or custom logs.

**Expected Result:** The integration of co2.js should be successful, and CO2e data should be logged for each page load during the test.

**Step 4:** Run the Test Case

1. Run the test case within the Cypress test runner.
2. Observe the test execution in the test runner interface.
3. Check the logs for CO2e data logged during page loads.

**Expected Result:** The test case should execute successfully, and CO2e data should be displayed in the logs.

**Step 5:** Validate CO2e Values

1. Review the CO2e values logged in the test runner's logs.
2. Compare the logged CO2e values with the expected values for each page load.

**Expected Result:** The calculated CO2e values should be reasonable and consistent with the nature of the web application's content.

**Step 6:** Evaluate Carbon Emission Impact

1. Analyze the CO2e values to identify pages or interactions that contribute significantly to carbon emissions.
2. Identify potential optimizations or changes to reduce emissions.

**Expected Result:** Insights from CO2e data should guide decisions to optimize the web application for reduced carbon emissions.

**Step 7:** Documentation

1. Document the integration steps, test case details, CO2e values, and optimization recommendations.
2. Include findings and insights in the test case documentation.

**Expected Result:** Comprehensive documentation of the test case, integration process, and optimization recommendations.

**Postconditions:**
1. The co2.js integration with Cypress for carbon emission tracking has been successfully tested.
2. Documentation includes CO2e values, insights, and optimization recommendations.

**Notes:**
- CO2e calculation accuracy might depend on the quality of the data provided to co2.js and its compatibility with the web application's content.
- Regular testing and optimization based on CO2e insights can contribute to improved technology sustainability.
