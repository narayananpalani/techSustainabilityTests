Test Case: Azure Cloud Footprint Configuration using Power BI Template Apps and Validated Carbon Accounting

**Test Case ID:** ACFTC-001  
**Test Case Title:** Azure Cloud Footprint Configuration using Power BI Template Apps and Validated Carbon Accounting

**Objective:** To configure an Azure cloud footprint analysis using Power BI template apps and validated carbon accounting, with a focus on improving technology sustainability through the Emissions Impact Dashboard for Azure.

**Preconditions:**
1. Access to an Azure cloud environment.
2. Azure services and resources have been utilized.

**Test Steps:**

**Step 1:** Access Azure Portal

1. Log in to the Azure Portal with appropriate credentials.
2. Ensure the necessary permissions to access Azure resources.

**Expected Result:** Successful login to the Azure Portal and access to Azure resources.

**Step 2:** Navigate to Template Apps

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to "Template Apps" or "Marketplace".
2. Search for the "Emissions Impact Dashboard for Azure" Power BI template app.
3. Select and install the app.

**Expected Result:** The Power BI template app for the "Emissions Impact Dashboard for Azure" is successfully installed.

**Step 3:** Connect Data Source

1. Open the Power BI template app.
2. Connect the template app to your Azure cloud environment.
3. Provide necessary credentials and access permissions.

**Expected Result:** The template app successfully establishes a connection with your Azure cloud environment.

**Step 4:** Configure Emissions Data

1. Follow the prompts to configure emissions data sources.
2. Provide necessary information about resource usage and emissions factors.

**Expected Result:** Emissions data is accurately configured and integrated into the template app.

**Step 5:** Generate Emissions Impact Dashboard

1. Use the Power BI template app to generate the "Emissions Impact Dashboard for Azure".
2. Verify the accuracy of data visualization and metrics presented.

**Expected Result:** The dashboard is generated with accurate emissions impact data, including visualizations and metrics.

**Step 6:** Validate Carbon Accounting

1. Compare the calculated emissions impact data from the Power BI dashboard with validated carbon accounting data (if available).
2. Verify that the emissions impact data aligns closely with validated accounting data.

**Expected Result:** The emissions impact data from the dashboard aligns closely with validated carbon accounting, demonstrating accurate calculations.

**Step 7:** Analyze and Optimize

1. Analyze the emissions impact data on the dashboard.
2. Identify areas where emissions can be reduced or optimized.
3. Implement strategies and changes to improve technology sustainability.

**Expected Result:** Actionable insights are derived from the emissions impact data, leading to informed decisions for improving technology sustainability.

**Step 8:** Monitor Progress

1. Regularly revisit the "Emissions Impact Dashboard for Azure" to monitor progress.
2. Observe how implemented changes impact emissions data over time.

**Expected Result:** The dashboard provides ongoing insights into the effects of sustainability initiatives.

**Postconditions:**
1. The Azure cloud footprint analysis has been successfully configured using Power BI template apps and validated carbon accounting.
2. Improvements to technology sustainability have been identified and implemented based on the emissions impact data.

**Notes:**
- The specific steps and interfaces mentioned in this test case may vary based on the actual Azure environment, Power BI template app version, and associated tools.
