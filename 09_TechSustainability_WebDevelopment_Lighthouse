**Expected Result:** The web application should load successfully.

**Step 2:** Open Google Lighthouse

1. Use the browser's developer tools to access the Google Lighthouse tool.
2. Configure Lighthouse to perform a scan of the web application.

**Expected Result:** Google Lighthouse should be opened and ready to run a scan.

**Step 3:** Run Lighthouse Scan with Default Settings

1. Start the Lighthouse scan using the default settings.

**Expected Result:** Lighthouse should perform a scan of the web application and generate a report based on default settings.

**Step 4:** Verify Performance Metrics

1. Review the Lighthouse report for performance metrics, including:
   - Page load time
   - Time to interactive
   - First Contentful Paint
   - Largest Contentful Paint
   - Cumulative Layout Shift

**Expected Result:** The web application's performance metrics should be within acceptable ranges as per web.dev recommendations.

**Step 5:** Review Accessibility and Best Practices

2. Ensure that the web application follows sustainable tech practices, including minimizing resource usage and optimizing for mobile devices.

**Expected Result:** The web application should adhere to recommended SEO guidelines and tech sustainability practices.

**Step 7:** Rerun Lighthouse Scan with Custom Settings

1. Modify the Lighthouse scan settings to target specific metrics or aspects of the web application's performance.
2. Run the Lighthouse scan again with the custom settings.

**Expected Result:** Lighthouse should generate a report based on the custom settings, highlighting specific performance areas for improvement.

**Step 8:** Verify Changes and Improvements

1. Implement the recommended changes based on the Lighthouse reports.
2. Rerun Lighthouse scans to confirm improvements in performance, accessibility, best practices, and tech sustainability.

**Expected Result:** The subsequent Lighthouse scans should show improvements in the targeted areas.

**Postconditions:**
1. The web application has been tested using Google Lighthouse scan settings and web.dev measures for optimization and tech sustainability.
2. All findings, changes, and improvements are documented for reference.

**Notes:**
- Google Lighthouse settings can be adjusted to focus on different aspects of web performance and optimization.
- Web.dev recommendations may evolve over time, so it's important to ensure the application adheres to the latest best practices.
