Test Case: Web Development Optimization through Dynatrace with Carbon Impact Settings Configuration for Improved Tech Sustainability

**Test Case ID:** WDODC-DYN-CARBON-001  
**Test Case Title:** Web Development Optimization through Dynatrace with Carbon Impact Settings Configuration for Improved Tech Sustainability

**Objective:** To optimize web development using Dynatrace's performance monitoring capabilities and configuring carbon impact settings for improved technology sustainability.

**Preconditions:**
1. A web application or website is available for testing.
2. Access to a Dynatrace environment is set up and configured.
3. Carbon impact tracking and settings configuration options are available within the Dynatrace platform.

**Test Steps:**

**Step 1:** Access Dynatrace Dashboard

1. Log in to the Dynatrace platform.
2. Navigate to the dashboard or overview page.

**Expected Result:** The Dynatrace dashboard should load and display key performance metrics.

**Step 2:** Monitor Application Performance

1. Select the web application or website to be tested.
2. Monitor various performance metrics, including page load times, server response times, and resource usage.

**Expected Result:** Performance data should be displayed accurately, and any performance bottlenecks should be identified.

**Step 3:** Identify Resource-Intensive Elements

1. Analyze the Dynatrace data to identify resource-intensive elements, such as scripts, images, or server requests.
2. Look for opportunities to optimize or reduce resource usage.

**Expected Result:** Resource-intensive elements are identified, and optimization opportunities are recognized.

**Step 4:** Configure Carbon Impact Settings

1. Access the carbon impact tracking and configuration settings within Dynatrace.
2. Configure settings to track the carbon impact of resource usage and server requests.
3. Set up carbon impact thresholds and alerts.

**Expected Result:** Carbon impact tracking settings are successfully configured.

**Step 5:** Analyze Carbon Impact

1. Monitor the carbon impact data alongside performance metrics.
2. Identify resource-intensive areas with a high carbon impact.
3. Compare carbon impact data with performance data to find correlations.

**Expected Result:** Areas with high carbon impact are identified, and their impact on overall performance is assessed.

**Step 6:** Implement Optimization Strategies

1. Based on the identified resource-intensive areas, implement optimization strategies.
2. For example, compress images, minimize scripts, and reduce server requests.

**Expected Result:** Optimization strategies are implemented, resulting in reduced resource usage and carbon impact.

**Step 7:** Monitor Improved Performance and Carbon Impact

1. Continue monitoring the web application's performance and carbon impact.
2. Compare the new performance metrics and carbon impact data with the baseline.

**Expected Result:** Improved performance and reduced carbon impact should be reflected in the monitoring data.

**Step 8:** Test Sustainability Thresholds and Alerts

1. Exceed the carbon impact thresholds intentionally by introducing resource-heavy elements.
2. Observe if the configured alerts and thresholds trigger notifications.

**Expected Result:** Alerts and notifications should be triggered when carbon impact exceeds configured thresholds.

**Postconditions:**
1. Web development optimization using Dynatrace with carbon impact settings configuration has been successfully tested.
2. Optimization strategies are implemented to reduce resource usage and improve technology sustainability.
3. Any issues, discrepancies, or performance improvements are documented.

**Notes:**
- This test case assumes that Dynatrace's features related to performance monitoring and carbon impact tracking are available and correctly configured.
- The specific optimization strategies will vary based on the nature of the web application and its resource usage patterns.
