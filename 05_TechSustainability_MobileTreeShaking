Test Case: Mobile App Optimization through Mobile Tree Shaking for Improved Technical Sustainability

**Test Case ID:** MAOTTS-001  
**Test Case Title:** Mobile App Optimization through Mobile Tree Shaking for Improved Technical Sustainability

**Objective:** To verify the effectiveness of mobile app optimization using the mobile tree shaking technique to improve technical sustainability by reducing app size and minimizing unused code.

**Preconditions:**
1. The mobile app's source code is available.
2. The app uses a modern JavaScript framework that supports tree shaking.
3. Development tools and dependencies are set up.

**Test Steps:**

**Step 1:** Review App's Initial Size

1. Obtain the initial size of the app's package (APK for Android or IPA for iOS).
2. Record the initial app size for comparison.

**Expected Result:** The initial size of the app is recorded.

**Step 2:** Identify Unused Code

1. Use a static analysis tool to identify unused or dead code within the app's source code.
2. Identify functions, modules, or components that are not being used.

**Expected Result:** A list of unused code is generated.

**Step 3:** Update Code for Tree Shaking

1. Review the list of unused code generated in the previous step.
2. Remove or refactor the identified unused code from the source code.
3. Ensure that the changes do not affect the app's core functionality.

**Expected Result:** The app's source code is updated to remove unused code.

**Step 4:** Configure Build Tools

1. Configure the build tools and settings to enable tree shaking.
2. Ensure that the bundler or compiler recognizes and performs tree shaking during the build process.

**Expected Result:** Build tools are configured to support tree shaking.

**Step 5:** Perform a Production Build

1. Build the app in production mode using the updated source code and the configured build tools.
2. Obtain the size of the generated app package (APK or IPA).

**Expected Result:** A production build of the app is generated.

**Step 6:** Compare Sizes

1. Compare the size of the production build with the initial app size.
2. Calculate the percentage reduction in app size achieved through tree shaking.

**Expected Result:** The app size is significantly reduced, and the percentage reduction is calculated.

**Step 7:** Test App Functionality

1. Install and run the optimized app on different devices and OS versions.
2. Test the app's functionality, including user interface, features, and interactions.

**Expected Result:** The app functions correctly with no adverse effects on user experience.

**Step 8:** Performance Testing (Optional)

1. Conduct performance testing, such as app launch time and responsiveness.
2. Measure the app's performance metrics before and after optimization.

**Expected Result:** The app's performance metrics show improvements or remain consistent.

**Step 9:** Monitor and Analyze Metrics (Ongoing)

1. Monitor the app's download and usage metrics post-optimization.
2. Track factors such as user engagement, app crashes, and user reviews.

**Expected Result:** The app's metrics show positive indicators, including improved user experience and fewer app crashes.

**Postconditions:**
1. The mobile app's technical sustainability is improved through mobile tree shaking.
2. App size reduction and optimization are successful without compromising functionality.
3. Any issues or discrepancies encountered during testing are documented.

**Notes:**
- Tree shaking is a technique used in modern JavaScript frameworks to eliminate dead code from the final bundle, reducing the app's size and improving performance.
- The effectiveness of tree shaking depends on the app's architecture and the quality of the initial codebase.
