Test Case: Microservices Optimization through Soak Testing for NFT Verification to Improve Tech Sustainability

**Test Case ID:** MO-ST-NFT-001  
**Test Case Title:** Microservices Optimization through Soak Testing for NFT Verification to Improve Tech Sustainability

**Objective:** To verify the performance and sustainability of microservices through soak testing, specifically focusing on Non-Functional Testing (NFT) results for the purpose of improving technological sustainability.

**Preconditions:**
1. A set of microservices in the system to be tested.
2. The microservices have been developed and deployed with the intent of optimizing for sustainability.
3. Tools for soak testing and performance monitoring are set up and ready for use.

**Test Steps:**

**Step 1:** Identify NFT Metrics

1. Collaborate with stakeholders to define NFT metrics that are aligned with improving tech sustainability, such as response time, resource utilization, memory consumption, and energy efficiency.

**Expected Result:** NFT metrics relevant to sustainability are established and agreed upon.

**Step 2:** Plan Soak Testing

1. Design a soak testing plan that outlines the duration, workload, and test scenarios.
2. Ensure that the testing plan incorporates both typical and peak usage scenarios.

**Expected Result:** A detailed soak testing plan is prepared and reviewed.

**Step 3:** Execute Soak Testing

1. Initiate the soak testing using the predefined test scenarios and workloads.
2. Monitor the microservices' performance metrics, including NFT metrics and any other relevant system metrics.
3. Run the soak tests for an extended duration, simulating sustained usage over time.

**Expected Result:** The soak testing runs successfully, and performance metrics are collected and monitored throughout the test.

**Step 4:** Analyze NFT Results

1. Analyze the collected performance metrics, paying particular attention to the NFT metrics aligned with sustainability.
2. Compare the NFT results against predefined benchmarks or targets.

**Expected Result:** NFT results are analyzed to identify areas of concern or potential improvements related to sustainability.

**Step 5:** Identify Optimization Opportunities

1. Based on the NFT results, identify microservices or components that exhibit suboptimal sustainability metrics.
2. Collaborate with development and operations teams to understand the underlying causes and potential optimization strategies.

**Expected Result:** Optimization opportunities are identified and documented.

**Step 6:** Implement Optimizations

1. Work with the development team to implement optimizations identified in the previous step.
2. Apply code changes, configuration adjustments, or architectural enhancements as necessary.

**Expected Result:** Optimization changes are implemented and tested.

**Step 7:** Repeat Soak Testing

1. Re-run the soak tests using the same scenarios and workloads as the initial testing.
2. Monitor the NFT metrics and system performance to evaluate the impact of the optimizations.

**Expected Result:** The second round of soak testing demonstrates improvements in sustainability-related NFT metrics.

**Step 8:** Report and Documentation

1. Prepare a comprehensive report that includes the initial NFT results, optimization actions taken, and the results of the subsequent soak test.
2. Document the lessons learned, challenges faced, and the overall impact on tech sustainability.

**Expected Result:** A well-documented report is ready for review and sharing with stakeholders.

**Postconditions:**
1. Microservices have undergone soak testing to verify NFT results for improving tech sustainability.
2. Optimization actions have been taken and their impact on sustainability metrics has been demonstrated.
3. A comprehensive report detailing the testing process, optimizations, and outcomes is available.

**Notes:**
- The test case assumes that the organization has a focus on improving tech sustainability and that the microservices are a part of a larger system.
- Actual NFT metrics and optimization strategies may vary based on the specifics of the microservices and the organization's goals.
