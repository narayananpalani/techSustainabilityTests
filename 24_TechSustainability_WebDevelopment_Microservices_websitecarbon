Test Case: Web Development for Tech Sustainability using WebsiteCarbon Scanner

**Test Case ID:** WDCS-001  
**Test Case Title:** Web Development for Tech Sustainability using WebsiteCarbon Scanner

**Objective:** To use the https://www.websitecarbon.com/ scanner to analyze a web page's carbon footprint and identify areas for improvement to enhance technical sustainability.

**Preconditions:**
1. Access to a web development environment.
2. Internet connectivity to access https://www.websitecarbon.com/.

**Test Steps:**

**Step 1:** Access WebsiteCarbon Scanner

1. Open a web browser.
2. Navigate to https://www.websitecarbon.com/.

**Expected Result:** The WebsiteCarbon scanner page should load successfully.

**Step 2:** Scan the Target Web Page

1. On the WebsiteCarbon scanner page, enter the URL of the web page you want to analyze.
2. Click the "Calculate" or "Scan" button to initiate the scanning process.
3. Wait for the scan to complete and the results to be displayed.

**Expected Result:** The scan should provide insights into the web page's carbon footprint, including the estimated amount of CO2 emissions produced during its loading.

**Step 3:** Analyze Scan Results

1. Review the scan results, which typically include metrics such as page weight, CO2 emissions, and potential savings.
2. Identify areas of improvement highlighted in the scan report, such as large images, excessive JavaScript, inefficient CSS, etc.

**Expected Result:** The scan results should provide actionable insights into aspects of the web page that contribute to its carbon footprint.

**Step 4:** Optimize Web Page Elements

1. Based on the scan results, apply optimization techniques to the identified areas of improvement. For example:
   - Compress and resize images.
   - Minify and concatenate JavaScript and CSS files.
   - Optimize server response times.
   - Reduce unnecessary third-party scripts and tracking.

**Expected Result:** The identified areas of improvement should be addressed through optimization techniques.

**Step 5:** Re-scan the Optimized Web Page

1. After making the optimizations, return to the WebsiteCarbon scanner.
2. Enter the URL of the optimized web page.
3. Perform another scan by clicking the "Calculate" or "Scan" button.

**Expected Result:** The re-scan should reflect reduced CO2 emissions and improved sustainability metrics compared to the initial scan.

**Step 6:** Compare Scan Results

1. Compare the scan results before and after optimization to assess the impact of the changes made.
2. Note the improvements in terms of CO2 emissions, page weight reduction, and potential savings.

**Expected Result:** The comparison should demonstrate the positive effects of optimization on the web page's carbon footprint.

**Postconditions:**
1. The target web page's carbon footprint has been analyzed using the WebsiteCarbon scanner.
2. Optimization techniques have been applied to improve the web page's technical sustainability.
3. Scan results, optimization actions, and their impact are documented for future reference.

**Notes:**
- The specific optimization techniques applied may vary depending on the findings from the scan results.
- Regular monitoring and optimization of web pages can contribute to reducing carbon emissions and enhancing overall tech sustainability.
