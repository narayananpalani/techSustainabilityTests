Test Case: Configuration of Carbon Sense Suite for Improved Tech Sustainability using Google Cloud

**Test Case ID:** GCS-CS-001  
**Test Case Title:** Configuration of Carbon Sense Suite for Improved Tech Sustainability using Google Cloud

**Objective:** To verify the successful configuration of the Carbon Sense Suite with customized settings for enhancing technology sustainability using Google Cloud services.

**Preconditions:**
1. Access to Google Cloud Platform.
2. A Carbon Sense Suite instance is available for configuration.
3. Relevant configuration details and preferences are defined.

**Test Steps:**

**Step 1:** Access Google Cloud Console

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Console.
2. Navigate to the appropriate project where the Carbon Sense Suite instance is located.

**Expected Result:** The Google Cloud Console for the specified project is accessible.

**Step 2:** Open Carbon Sense Suite Configuration

1. Locate and select the Carbon Sense Suite instance.
2. Look for options related to configuration or settings.

**Expected Result:** The Carbon Sense Suite configuration options are accessible.

**Step 3:** Configure Energy Consumption Tracking

1. Within the Carbon Sense Suite configuration:
2. Enable energy consumption tracking for various devices, services, or components.
3. Specify the types of devices or services to track (e.g., servers, cloud resources).
4. Define intervals for tracking energy usage (e.g., daily, weekly).
5. Configure alerts or notifications for excessive energy consumption.

**Expected Result:** Energy consumption tracking is successfully configured as per the defined settings.

**Step 4:** Implement Resource Optimization Strategies

1. In the Carbon Sense Suite configuration:
2. Enable resource optimization features to identify inefficiencies.
3. Configure rules to automatically optimize resources based on predefined thresholds (e.g., auto-scaling, resource consolidation).
4. Define acceptable performance levels for optimization to avoid disrupting critical operations.

**Expected Result:** Resource optimization strategies are successfully configured and applied.

**Step 5:** Set Sustainability Goals

1. Within the Carbon Sense Suite configuration:
2. Define sustainability goals and targets related to energy reduction, carbon emissions, or resource usage.
3. Specify preferred metrics for measuring sustainability (e.g., kilowatt-hours, CO2 equivalent).
4. Set timelines for achieving sustainability goals.

**Expected Result:** Sustainability goals are successfully set and aligned with desired targets.

**Step 6:** Configure Reporting and Analytics

1. In the Carbon Sense Suite configuration:
2. Set up automated reporting and analytics.
3. Define report frequency (e.g., weekly, monthly).
4. Customize report templates to include relevant metrics and data visualization.

**Expected Result:** Reporting and analytics are successfully configured to provide insights into sustainability improvements.

**Step 7:** Test Configuration Changes

1. Save the configured settings in the Carbon Sense Suite.
2. Trigger mock data or scenarios to simulate energy consumption, optimization, and sustainability goal achievements.
3. Monitor the system's response to the configured changes.

**Expected Result:** The Carbon Sense Suite responds to the configuration changes as expected, including tracking, optimization, and reporting.

**Postconditions:**
1. The Carbon Sense Suite is successfully configured with custom settings for improved technology sustainability.
2. Configuration details, adjustments made, and any issues encountered during testing are documented.

**Notes:**
- This test case assumes familiarity with the Carbon Sense Suite and Google Cloud Platform's services.
- The actual configuration options and steps may vary based on the Carbon Sense Suite version and Google Cloud services used.
