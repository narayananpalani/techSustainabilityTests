**Test Case Title:** Web Development Sustainability Test using WeDeex Plugin

**Objective:** To verify the effectiveness of the WeDeex plugin in improving the technical sustainability of a web page during the development process.

**Preconditions:**
1. A web page under development with WeDeex plugin integrated.
2. Relevant development environment and tools are set up.
3. The WeDeex plugin is installed and configured.

**Test Steps:**

**Step 1:** Open Web Page in Development Environment

1. Launch the web development environment.
2. Open the web page under development.

**Expected Result:** The web page should load successfully in the development environment.

**Step 2:** Activate WeDeex Plugin

1. Access the WeDeex plugin within the development environment.
2. Activate the plugin on the current web page.

**Expected Result:** The WeDeex plugin should be successfully activated on the web page.

**Step 3:** Run WeDeex Analysis

1. Initiate the WeDeex analysis process on the web page.
2. Allow the plugin to scan the page for sustainability-related issues.

**Expected Result:** The WeDeex plugin should complete the analysis without errors and provide a summary of findings.

1. Examine the list of sustainability-related recommendations provided by the WeDeex plugin.
2. Check the severity level and description of each recommendation.

**Expected Result:** The recommendations should be clear and relevant, addressing areas where the web page's technical sustainability can be improved.

**Step 5:** Implement WeDeex Recommendations

1. Based on the recommendations, make necessary changes to the web page's code and structure.
2. Apply the suggested optimizations to enhance the page's sustainability.

**Expected Result:** The recommended changes should be implemented accurately, and the code should remain error-free.

**Step 6:** Test Web Page Performance

1. Load the modified web page in different web browsers and devices.
2. Evaluate the page's performance, loading speed, and responsiveness.

**Expected Result:** The modified web page should perform better in terms of speed and responsiveness, demonstrating improved sustainability.

**Step 7:** Validate Accessibility

1. Run accessibility tests on the modified web page using relevant tools or plugins.
2. Ensure that the accessibility features of the page have not been compromised by the sustainability improvements.

**Expected Result:** The web page's accessibility should still meet relevant accessibility standards after implementing the sustainability improvements.

**Step 8:** Verify Code Quality

1. Use code analysis tools to validate the quality of the modified code.
2. Ensure that the code remains clean, maintainable, and follows best practices.

**Expected Result:** The code quality should not degrade, and the modifications should align with coding standards.

**Postconditions:**
1. The web page's technical sustainability has been tested and improved using the WeDeex plugin.
2. All changes and improvements are documented for reference.
