**Test Case ID:** DCEO-001  
**Test Case Title:** Data Center Energy Optimization for Improved Tech Sustainability

**Objective:** To verify the effectiveness and impact of energy optimization measures in a data center environment to enhance technology sustainability and reduce energy consumption.

**Preconditions:**
1. A data center facility equipped with energy monitoring and optimization solutions.
2. Energy consumption data and metrics are available for analysis.
3. Energy optimization strategies have been implemented and configured.

**Test Steps:**

**Step 1:** Monitor Baseline Energy Consumption

1. Collect baseline energy consumption data for the data center over a defined period.
2. Document the energy usage patterns and peak load times.

**Expected Result:** Baseline energy consumption data is obtained for comparison with optimized energy consumption.

**Step 2:** Implement Energy Optimization Measures

1. Activate energy optimization measures, which may include:
   - Server virtualization
   - Dynamic workload balancing
   - Cooling optimization
   - Efficient lighting systems
   - Renewable energy sources integration
   - Hardware upgrades for energy efficiency

**Expected Result:** Energy optimization measures are successfully activated and configured.

**Step 3:** Monitor Optimized Energy Consumption

1. Monitor energy consumption data after implementing optimization measures.
2. Compare the optimized energy consumption with the baseline data.

**Expected Result:** Optimized energy consumption should demonstrate a reduction in energy usage compared to the baseline.

**Step 4:** Measure Impact on Cooling Efficiency

1. Analyze the efficiency of cooling systems with the energy optimization measures in place.
2. Monitor temperature and humidity levels within the data center.

**Expected Result:** Cooling efficiency should improve, resulting in stable temperature and humidity levels.

**Step 5:** Verify Server Workload Balancing

1. Monitor server workload distribution using workload management tools.
2. Ensure that workload balancing is effectively redistributing tasks to optimize resource usage.

**Expected Result:** Workload balancing should prevent resource overutilization and reduce energy waste.

**Step 6:** Assess Renewable Energy Integration (if applicable)

1. Monitor the contribution of renewable energy sources (e.g., solar panels, wind turbines) to overall energy consumption.
2. Verify that renewable energy sources are integrated and utilized effectively.

**Expected Result:** The use of renewable energy sources should contribute to lowering the data center's carbon footprint.

**Step 7:** Measure Overall Energy Efficiency

1. Calculate Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) before and after optimization.
2. Compare the PUE values to assess the overall energy efficiency improvement.

**Expected Result:** Optimized PUE values should indicate improved energy efficiency.

**Step 8:** Analyze Cost Savings

1. Calculate energy cost savings resulting from the optimization measures.
2. Compare the cost savings to the investment made in implementing energy optimization solutions.

**Expected Result:** Cost savings should justify the investment in energy optimization.

**Step 9:** Review Environmental Impact

1. Assess the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from energy optimization.
2. Compare the environmental impact before and after implementation.

**Expected Result:** Energy optimization should contribute to reduced environmental impact.

**Postconditions:**
1. The data center's energy optimization measures have been tested and verified for their effectiveness.
2. A comprehensive report detailing energy consumption reduction, cost savings, and environmental benefits is generated.

**Notes:**
- The effectiveness of energy optimization measures may vary based on the data center's infrastructure, technology used, and specific optimization strategies implemented.
- Real-world monitoring and data analysis should be conducted over an appropriate timeframe to capture accurate results.
