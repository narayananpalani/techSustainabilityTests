**Test Case ID:** MAOAS-GAS-001  
**Test Case Title:** Mobile App Optimization through Accessibility Scan using Google Accessibility Scanner

**Objective:** To verify the optimization of a mobile app's accessibility through an accessibility scan using the Google Accessibility Scanner, promoting SDG Goal No. 10 (Reduced Inequalities) by improving tech sustainability and ensuring digital inclusion.

**Preconditions:**
1. The mobile app under test is installed on an Android device.
2. Google Accessibility Scanner is installed on the Android device.

**Test Steps:**

**Step 1:** Access the Google Accessibility Scanner

1. Open the Google Accessibility Scanner app on the Android device.

**Expected Result:** The Google Accessibility Scanner app should open successfully.

**Step 2:** Select the App for Testing

1. In the Google Accessibility Scanner app, tap on "Select app" or a similar option.
2. Choose the mobile app to be tested from the list of installed apps.

**Expected Result:** The selected app should be successfully loaded for testing in the Google Accessibility Scanner.

**Step 3:** Run Accessibility Scan

1. Initiate the accessibility scan by tapping on the "Analyze" or "Scan" button within the Google Accessibility Scanner app.
2. Allow the scan to run and analyze the app's accessibility.

**Expected Result:** The accessibility scan should be successfully completed, and the app's accessibility issues should be identified and categorized.

**Step 4:** Review Accessibility Findings

1. After the scan is complete, review the accessibility findings provided by the Google Accessibility Scanner.
2. Observe the list of issues, warnings, and suggestions related to the app's accessibility.

**Expected Result:** The Google Accessibility Scanner should display a comprehensive list of accessibility issues found within the app.

**Step 5:** Address Accessibility Issues

1. For each identified accessibility issue, follow the provided guidance or recommendations to address the issues.
2. Make necessary changes to the app's user interface, interactions, and content to improve accessibility.

**Expected Result:** Accessibility issues addressed during testing should result in improved app accessibility.

**Step 6:** Re-run Accessibility Scan (Optional)

1. If changes were made to address accessibility issues, initiate another accessibility scan using the Google Accessibility Scanner.
2. Review the new scan results to verify if the addressed issues have been resolved.

**Expected Result:** Re-running the scan after addressing accessibility issues should show a reduction in identified issues.

**Step 7:** Verify Accessibility Improvements

1. Manually test the app's user interface, interactions, and content to ensure the addressed accessibility issues have been successfully resolved.
2. Use assistive technologies (e.g., TalkBack) to navigate the app and ensure the app is now more accessible.

**Expected Result:** The app should exhibit improved accessibility and provide a more inclusive user experience.

**Step 8:** Document and Report

1. Document the accessibility issues identified during the initial scan.
2. Document the changes made to address those issues.
3. Provide a summary of the improvements achieved through the accessibility scan and optimization process.

**Expected Result:** A comprehensive document outlining the accessibility testing process, issues, improvements, and outcomes should be created for reporting and documentation purposes.

**Postconditions:**
1. The mobile app has undergone optimization to improve accessibility through an accessibility scan using the Google Accessibility Scanner.
2. A report highlighting the accessibility improvements and the impact on tech sustainability has been documented.

**Notes:**
- The test case is aligned with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) No. 10: Reduced Inequalities, by promoting digital inclusion through improved accessibility.
- The specific steps and options within the Google Accessibility Scanner may vary based on app updates and changes.
